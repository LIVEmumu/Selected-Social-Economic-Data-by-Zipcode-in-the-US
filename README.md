# Selected-Social-Economic-Data-by-Zipcode-in-the-US

I have been struggling finding information by zip code on the internet, so I decided to post the table I made and offer help to those who still looking for this kind of data. 

The csv file is the result generated by the R code file.   

The social economic data comes from:  
<https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml>  
I used the following 3 tables:  
DP03 SELECTED ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS  
DP05 ACS DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING ESTIMATES  
S1501 EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT    



Zip code information comes from:  
<http://federalgovernmentzipcodes.us/>

Since zip codes change a lot and the zip code data is from 2012, there are plenty of NAs in the file. You can use your own zip code information to merge this data and remove NAs in the process.
